# # ChatGPT Auto-Resume Builder with Latex

##  Project Description
The auto resume generating code project is designed to create a personalized and visually appealing resume template. The process involves training ChatGPT as a LaTeX editor to generate a sample template that meets the user's basic criteria and design preferences. The user can then customize the template to their liking, ensuring that it is error-free and functional for auto resume generation.

Once the template is finalized, the user can input their personal information via a resume information prompt, which ChatGPT will automatically extract and use to populate the template. The final output will be in the form of a LaTeX code, which the user can copy and paste into an Overleaf template to complete their resume.

Overall, this project aims to streamline the resume generation process, minimizing manual work and allowing the user to focus on the content of their resume while still producing a polished and professional-looking document.

##   Procedure:
1. Train ChatGPT as a LaTeX editor to create a personalized resume template.
<br> **_Prompt: I want you to be a LaTex editor, reply everything in the following in the latex form_**

2. Ask ChatGPT to generate a sample resume template that meets the basic criteria and design preferences of the user. Although the generated template may not be perfect, it should provide a solid foundation to work with.
<br> **_Prompt: Show me a resume template in Latex_**

3. Based on the generated template, the user can modify it to create a more customized and visually appealing resume layout. The user should ensure that the template is error-free and functional for auto resume generation.

4. Provide a resume information prompt to ChatGPT for the user to input their personal information. ChatGPT should be able to extract the relevant information and automatically populate the resume template with the user's information.
<br> **_Prompt: Now I will give you a resume template, and I want you to fill in the resume with the given information_**

5. Once the information is populated, ChatGPT can output the resume as a LaTeX code. The user can then copy and paste the code into an Overleaf template to complete the resume.


Overall, this approach ensures that the user has a tailored resume template, personalized to their preferences and designed for optimal readability. It also streamlines the resume generation process, minimizing the manual work and allowing the user to focus on the content of their resume.
